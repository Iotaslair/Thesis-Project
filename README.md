# Thesis-Project
 
This project is the code that was developed for my Undergraduate Thesis Titled "An automated approach to Software Engineering team creation". It contains the algorithm that generates random people, and scores each of the teams. This process utitilzes the [Five Factor Model of Personality]( http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=195B61D62AE7E311375844FD1D7F0DE3?doi=10.1.1.470.4858&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and the [MWEP (Multidimensional Work Ethic Profile)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.632.514&rep=rep1&type=pdf). I believe that through the combination of these two models one can form teams that form teams that are more compatible and work well in the long term.
